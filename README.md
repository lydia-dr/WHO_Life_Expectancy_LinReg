# WHO Linear Regression Model

A linear regression project to predict Life Expectancy using World Health Organisation (WHO) data. The project was completed as part of a team of five for the Digital Futures Academy.

This project contains three main files:

1. The Model_Creation file which contains the cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature selection and ultimately model training on the data.

2. The Life_Expectancy_Prediction_Model which contains a function that allows for predictions on novel inputs.
   
3. The script used to deploy the prediction model via streamlit:
