# WHO Linear Regression Model

A linear regression project to predict life expectancy using World Health Organisation (WHO) data. The project was completed as part of a team of five for the Digital Futures Academy.

This project contains two main files:

The Model_Creation file which contains the cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature selection and ultimately model training on the data.

The Life_Expectancy_Prediction_Model which contains a function (or functions) that allow for predictions on novel inputs. The prediction is self-contained for ease of use.
