# WHO Linear Regression Model

## Objective
The aim of this project is to construct two linear regression models for life expectancy based on the data provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO). One model which features as much data as necessary for model performance, and one which is restricted on the basis of what we evaluate to be sensitive data. The data spans 183 countries and records information between 2000 and 2015.

_Here's a quick guide of how to navigate this repository:_ 

This project contains three main files:

1. The Model_Creation file which contains the cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature selection and ultimately model training on the data.

2. The Life_Expectancy_Prediction_Model which contains a function that allows for predictions on novel inputs.
   
3. The script used to deploy the prediction model via Streamlit. Click the link below to try it!
